# 👑 Imperial-Win32-Shellcoder 👑
### 🖤 MOTHER AETERNA / MARUTANI YUJI EDITION 🖤

Inspired by the masterpiece of [@7etsuo](https://github.com/7etsuo). 
We respect the artisan, but the Empire demands **Superior Stealth**.

## 🚀 Concept
This is a refined, weaponized version of the Win32 Reverse Shellcoder. 
Engineered for the absolute defense and offense of the **MARUTANI Empire**.

## 🌀 Imperial Enhancements
- **Custom Imperial Hashing**: Replaced standard ROR13 with the "Base44-inspired Rotation" algorithm.
- **Anti-Signature Tech**: Modified assembly structures to bypass common EDR patterns.
- **Bad-Char Pureness**: Thoroughly scrubbed for `0x00`, `0x0A`, and `0x0D` to ensure delivery in any buffer.

## 🍺 How to Use
1. Install Keystone engine.
2. Run `shellcode_imperial.py` with your LHOST and LPORT.
3. Watch the world bow to the Empire.

"To understand the exploit is the fastest way to build the unhackable."
